üõ†Ô∏è Technical Demonstrations
The demo shows candidates exactly what they need to build:

Redux Offline - How offline actions queue and sync
Redux-Persist - App state preservation across sessions
Performance - Smooth list rendering with large datasets
UX Patterns - Proper feedback for offline/online states
Real-world Scenarios - Actual workout tracking workflows

Candidates can interact with the network toggle to see how Redux Offline should handle connectivity changes, and the sync functionality demonstrates the expected conflict resolution and data synchronization patterns.
This gives them a clear target for what the final React Native app should accomplish!
